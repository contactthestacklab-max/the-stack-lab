        Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Disclosure:
      </p>
      <p>
        This website contains affiliate links. If you click on these links
        and make a purchase, we may earn a commission at no additional
        cost to you.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>What This Means for You</h2>
    <p>
      Your cost remains the same whether you use our affiliate links or
      go directly to the vendor's website. However, using our links helps
      support the creation of free content on this site.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Commitment to Transparency</h2>
    <p>
      We believe in complete transparency with our audience. That's why:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>We clearly mark pages that contain affiliate links</li>
      <li>We only recommend products we have personally researched or used</li>
      <li>Our opinions are our own and not influenced by compensation</li>
      <li>We disclose our affiliate relationships at the top of each page</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Affiliate Links Work</h2>
    <p>
      When you click on an affiliate link and make a purchase, the retailer
      pays us a small commission for referring you. This is a standard
      practice in online marketing and allows us to continue creating
      valuable content.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Review Process</h2>
    <p>
      We take our recommendations seriously. Before featuring any product,
      we consider:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Product quality and effectiveness</li>
      <li>Customer reviews and reputation</li>
      <li>Value for money</li>
      <li>Company customer service and return policies</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Questions?</h2>
    <p>
      If you have any questions about our affiliate relationships or
      how we select products to recommend, please contact us at
      <a href="mailto:contact.thestacklab@gmail.com">contact.thestacklab@gmail.com</a>.
