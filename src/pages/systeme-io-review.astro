  // PROBLEM (P)
  problemTitle: "The 'Technical Debt' Bottleneck: Why Most Digital Ventures Fail",
  problemText: `
    <p>At The Stack Lab, we've audited hundreds of digital infrastructures. The pattern is always the same: entrepreneurs convinced that professional authority requires a "Frankenstein" tech stack. You know the drill—a $97/mo email tool, a $149/mo funnel builder, and a $50/mo checkout system that barely talks to the rest. Every morning started with checking if the APIs were still holding up, rather than focusing on growth.</p>

    <p>We analyzed the industry giants. We spent a fortune on the big names everyone sees in YouTube ads, hoping that a higher price tag meant a smoother experience. Instead, we inherited a steep learning curve and a monthly overhead that suffocated our early-stage margins. The tools weren't working for us; we were working for the tools.</p>

    <p>The result? "Tech-paralysis." We felt discouraged, watching our competitors scale while we were stuck in the back-office, fixing broken automations. It was a constant drain on both our budget and our creative energy, leading us to believe that high-tier marketing was a luxury reserved for those with massive budgets.</p>
